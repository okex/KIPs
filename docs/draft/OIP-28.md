## 1. Introduction

A rich blockchain ecosystem cannot do without the dedication of a group of excellent programmers. A good developer community can not only improve the work efficiency of developers, but also attract more community developers to contribute to the development of the blockchain ecosystem. At this stage, the official provides English version of OKChain document, which provides a certain basis for developers to understand OKChain, but there is also a steep learning curve. Due to language barrier or weak software development ability, some developers can not fully understand the content of official documents, so they need a more open, timely and accurate information exchange platform.

## 2. Summary

This OIP aims to provide a convenient communication platform for developers.

## 3. Proposal

Combined with the common needs of OKChain developers at this stage, we have helped the official launch of a developer community to facilitate the discussion of technology, exchange of experience and access to the latest information, and provide a platform for the government to gather the wisdom of the public and collect various dapps. The main functions include:

#### a. Latest news

This module releases and updates the latest news of OKChain in time.

#### b. Discussion on technical issues

This module is for everyone to discuss technology, exchange development experience, and discuss problems encountered in the development process.

#### c. Feedback questions

This module is for the official to collect OKChain related problems and program errors, and to provide channels for the community members to feedback OKChain improvement suggestions to the official.

#### d. Reward task

This module is for the official paid collection of OKChain related DAPP or function.
