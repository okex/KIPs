## Partnership Proposal


### OKExChain intergartion with Cosmostation Mobile Wallet (iOS & Android)


#### 1.1 Overview
Cosmostation develops, operates, and maintains all of its services in the spirit of the Cypherpunk manifesto. Cosmostation iOS & Android are developed with a heavy focus on the end-user's convenience. Cosmostaiton Mobile is the wallet of choice for the majority of users within the Cosmos SDK & Tendermint ecosystem.

Integrating OKExChain to Cosmostation Mobile Wallet will allow for OKExChain users to access the blockchain with a intuitive and secure user interface, allowing for more accessibility and usability. Cosmostation Mobile Wallet is specifically designed in a way that the application can support custom modules specific to each blockchain in a comprehensible UI/UX.


#### 1.2 Integration Details
Both the iOS & Android applications currently support the Cosmos Hub, Kava Network, Binance Chain, Iris Hub, and Band Protocol. Adding OKExChain to Cosmostation Mobile Wallet will expose OKExChain to the wider Cosmos SDK community who are actively using the Cosmostation Application.

Integration work will first begin with simple withdrawal & deposit of tokens, and will sequentially be updated to support custom modules specific to OKExChain such as delegation, undelegation, claim rewards, redelegation, etc.
