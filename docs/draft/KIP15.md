YOYOW is a content value network based on blockchain technology. Its goal is to build a blockchain network that uses blockchain technology to quantify contribution in the content production area using a decentralized consensus method. The YOYOW project has completed the development of multiple versions of mainnet and supporting projects since its launch in 2017. Multiple new features will be added to the YOYOW 3.0 being developed by the YOYOW Foundation development team, including the support of Turing-complete smart contract, Smart Content Token and inter-blockchain communication.

Through the cooperation between the YOYOW Foundation and OKExChain, the two parties will be committed to building an interconnected inter-blockchain ecosystem, bringing USDK, OpenDEX, OKT, OKB and other Defi services provided by OKExChain to the YOYOW blockchain via inter-blockchain technology. At the same time, the smart tokens of the YOYOW blockchain can also be applied to the OKExChain ecosystem through inter-blockchain technology to jointly strengthen and improve the ecology of the OKExChain and YOYOW blockchain.
 
# Cooperation Program

# 1) The YOYOW Foundation, as an ecological partner of OKExChain, will participate in the node scheme of OKExChain

The YOYOW Foundation has rich experience in blockchain development, blockchain maintenance and operation, and will deploy OKExChain node and participate in OKExChainâ€™s node scheme.
 
# 2) Through the support of Tendermint PegZone inter-blockchain technology, realize the inter-blockchain of YOYOW smart tokens and introduce USDK stablecoin assets and OKT/OKB tokens to the YOYOW blockchain
 
In YOYOW 3.0, Tendermint PegZone inter-blockchain technology will be released. Through PegZone, the inter-blockchain between YOYOW and OKExChain can be achieved. YOYOW can introduce USDK, OKT, OKB, and other assets on OKExChain. At the same time, the assets on YOYOW can also be transferred to OKExChain through PegZone inter-blockchain technology and YOYOW can also use various Defi services provided by OKExChain.
 
# 3) Realize the trusted interoperability of token assets supporting heterogeneous blockchains such as BTC/ETH/EOS between OKExChain and YOYOW and other blockchains through HTLC
 
In addition to Tendermint PegZone inter-blockchain technology, YOYOW 3.0 will also support HTLC so as to support heterogeneous inter-blockchain. Heterogeneous inter-blockchain technology will open up the connection between blockchains with different architectures such as BTC/ETH/EOS, through which the connection between OKExChain OpenDEX and YOYOW DEX can be established, improving the liquidity and richness of trading pairs for OKExChain OpenDEX and YOYOW DEX. It aims to realize the introduction of a variety of heterogeneous tokens and achieve trusted interoperability on this basis and achieve a true "myriad blockchain interconnection".

The YOYOW 3.0 roadmap will introduce high-performance smart contracts and WebAssembly virtual machines. The high-performance WASM runtime will support the execution of smart contracts written in the C++ programming language, allowing developers to use existing tools to develop various smart contracts and dApps (decentralized applications) for the YOYOW blockchain. At the same time, the smart contract feature of the YOYOW blockchain can also realize various applications including Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Decentralized Games, Commodity Anti-counterfeiting Traceability and Digital Asset Management.
