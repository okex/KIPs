## 1. Introduction
Now, OKEXChain software ecosystem is lack of competitive DAPPS. One important reason is that the software development kit is not perfect. At present, official have provided go, Java and JavaScript SDKs. Go, Java and JavaScript developers can easily develop DAPPS based on OKEXChain. However, developers of other programming languages, such as Pythoner and PHPer, have relatively high complexity in developing applications. Python is one of the top three programming languages in TIOBE index. Providing Python SDK can bring more applications to OKEXChain software ecosystem.

## 2. Summary

This KIP aims to provide a python sdk for OKEXChain.

## 3. Proposal

We plan to implement common functions related to OKEXChain, such as information query, transaction, account operation, etc. In order to reduce the learning curve, the use of each function has detailed documentation and examples. 

## 4. Status

This is under implementation.
