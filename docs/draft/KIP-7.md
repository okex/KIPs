About **NULS**

NULS is an open-source, enterprise-grade, adaptive blockchain platform that offers fast-track business solutions for developers. Featuring microservices, smart contracts, cross-chain interoperability, and instant chain-building, NULS sets a new industry standard in streamlining blockchain adoption.

The microservice-layer design of NULS makes it easy for developers to quickly create modules for anything. NULS provides fluid, cost-effective, time-saving solutions for developers with minimum blockchain experience.

**NULS is a modular open source blockchain infrastructure.**

**Its flagship products are below:**

1.**POCM platform**

POCM (Proof of Credit Mining) is an SCO Platform that allows projects to use smart-contracts to issue and distribute project tokens on blockchains. Got NULS? Stake into a project’s nodes and earn their token as reward, while the project earns NULS as reward. Projects can use the NULS consensus rewards to bootstrap and help fund development. Unlike IEOs and ICOs, stakers never risk their principal, and NULS never leave their wallet. Earn project tokens while your device is off! As a universal SCO Platform, POCM can be used to issue and distribute tokens and assets from any public chain in any blockchain ecosystem.

\2. **NULS ChainBox**

ChainBox is an out-of-the-box solution to chain-building. It encapsulates six underlying modules: ledger, accounts, transactions, blocks, consensus, and network. ChainBox eliminates the necessity of understanding any underlying blockchain technology including distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanisms, and encryption algorithms. Instead of spending time on blockchain architecture, developers can focus on creating independent business modules based on standard communication protocols, then form a brand new application chain in minutes with ChainBox.

\3. **Chainfactory**

Chainfactory allows you to build a blockchain that meets your unique needs with minimum coding ability. Our step-by-step graphical interface guides you through configuration of your chain using the Module Warehouse.

**About** **Nerve****Network**

Nervenetwork is a decentralized digital asset service network and a blockchain cross-chain interaction protocol based on NULS microservice framework and developed with NULS ChainBox. It aims to break the Isolated value island of the blockchain, establish a cross-chain asset interaction network, and provide all the necessary underlying support for the Defi application ecosystem. Let every digital asset holder enjoys truly secure, free and transparent Defi application services.

 NerveNetwork is a decentralized network of digital asset services and a blockchain cross-chain interaction protocol based on NULS microservice framework and developed with NULS ChainBox. It aims to break the isolated value island of the blockchain, establish a cross-chain asset interaction network, and provide all the necessary underlying support for the Defi application ecology. Let every digital asset holder enjoys the real security, freedom, and transparency of the Defi application services. Through the Nerve cross-chain interaction protocol, only a small amount of development is needed through the standard interface, and then the blockchain with different structures can be transformed into a set of common asset types that can be identified by the cross-chain modules in the NULS ecosystem. In this way, we can achieve the asset interaction inside and outside of the NULS ecosystem, and provide rich Defi scenarios for mainstream digital assets such as BTC.

**NULS** **advantages of the underlying technology**

Microservice architecture, modularization is more thorough, consensus mechanism is pluggable, modules operate independently, low coupling, and high expansion flexibility.

**Cooperation solutions**

**1.**It is recommended that OKExChain adopt Nerve heterogeneous cross-chain ecological cooperation

**1.1** **It is recommended that OKExChain join the Nerve virtual bank node**

The project of NerveNetwork is willing to provide support for virtual bank nodes.

NerveNetwork has 15 virtual bank nodes in total, which not only have the power to generate revenue from blocks, but also correspond to the management rights of 15 multi-signature private keys.it is responsible for the multi-signature management of BTC and the management of the private key of the Ethereum smart contract signature, it is a distributed asset management manager.

The virtual bank node assumes the role of cross-chain governance, voting on some on-chain proposals for various asset issues that occur during the cross-chain process, and reviewing asset proposals with a 66% Byzantine verification mechanism, including those that occur during the transfer of cross-chain assets processing of freezing, returning and transferring.

**1.2 It is recommended that Nerve provide a heterogeneous cross-chain solution to help to support the access of mainstream assets such as BTC, ETH, ERC20, and NULS.**

As a universal cross-chain protocol, Nerve will access various mainstream assets. The first batch of mainnet will access BTC, ETH, ERC20, NULS, NRC20 and other chain assets and contract assets. Through the connection with OKExChain, it can provide rich assets access for OKExChain and OKExChain DEX, and can participate in the on-chain governance of these assets, which not only ensures the safety of assets, but also provides flexibly services for OKExChain.

**Nerve’s block generation time is confirmed within 3S. It adopts the POCBFT consensus mechanism and has no rollback transactions. It is very suitable as a lightning network solution for long-term confirmed mainstream assets.**

**2. NULS and OKExChain heterogeneous cross-chain ecological cooperation**

**2.1 It is recommended that OKExChain participates in the maintenance of NULS’ block generating nodes.**

After becoming a virtual bank node, the pool not only has rewards from the Nerve virtual bank, but also rewards for generating blocks. The pool can also stake the holding NULS, Ethereum, and [Bitcoin](https://www.okex.com/academy/en)for Nerve’s mining output.

**2.2 It is recommended that NULS smart contract DApp & Defi can support OKT asset access**

All assets in Nerve can be transferred to the NULS chain through the NULS relay protocol. Assets on NULS chain can support the development and application of OKExChain assets’ smart contracts. For example, the digital identity and distributed storage Aleph network on the NULS chain . and NULS have reached cooperation with Ledger.

In addition, governance tools and POCM also can be quickly accessed.

**2.3 It is recommended that the NULS Nabox wallet provide support for heterogeneous cross-chain assets from OKExChain to NULS**


The NULS ecological wallet Nabox App is currently used by 10000+ real users at high frequencies, and can support the access and storage of OKExChain cross-chain assets.
