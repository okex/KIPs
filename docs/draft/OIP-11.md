## Proposal

Basiclly, the development will follow [OKChain HTTP API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1112175/SzS5u6bE?version=latest#f5bc92c9-4e8c-40f5-b3fe-d9635c418402).

Additionally, will use the existed Go and Java SDK as references.

The SDK will provide both `sync` and `async` implementations.
