## Introduction

### About Squeezer

Squeezer is all-in-all solution created with the main goal to access blockchain as a service (BAAS) and to make the job easier to the worldwide developers to build and deploy dApps on different blockchains. We use microservices as backbone (AWS Lambda) in order to provide stability and scalability on dApps. Squeezer has over 6000 downloads and is starred on GitHub by 3000+ developers. Squeezer includes three main components in order to facilitate blockchain development. 

1. Squeezer Framework

Is an open source CLI for building and deploying decentralized applications.

2. Squeezer Platform

Team collaboration and continuous integration (CI). Import a project from Github, share it with your team and start the development in seconds.

3. ChainKit

Access blockchain as a service. Start building dApp by using ChainKit without being required to configure blockchain nodes or add extra infrastructures.
