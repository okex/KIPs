OKChain Improvement Proposals (OIPs)
====================================

OKChain Improvement Proposals (OIPs) describe standards for the OKChain
platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and
contract standards.

Contributing
============

1. Review OIP-1.
2. Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.
3. Add your OIP to your fork of the repository.
4. Submit a Pull Request to OKChain's OIPs repository.

Once your first PR is merged, we have a bot that helps out by
automatically merging PRs to draft OIPs. For this to work, it has to be
able to tell that you own the draft being edited. Make sure that the
'author' line of your OIP contains either your GitHub username or your
email address inside.

OIP Status Terms
================

-  Draft - an OIP that is undergoing rapid iteration and changes.
-  Last Call - an OIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready
   for review by a wide audience.
-  Accepted - a Matching trading Engine OIP that has been in Last Call
   for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested
   have been addressed by the author. The process for Core Devs to
   decide whether to encode an OIP into their clients as part of a hard
   fork is not part of the OIP process. If such a decision is made, the
   OIP will move to final.
-  Final (non- Matching trading Engine ） - an OIP that has been in Last
   Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were
   requested have been addressed by the author.
-  Final (Matching trading Engine） - an OIP that the Core Devs have
   decided to implement and release in a future hard fork or has already
   been released in a hard fork.

Preferred Citation Format
=========================

The canonical URL for a OIP that has achieved draft status at any point
is at https://github.com/okex/OIPs. For example, the canonical URL for
EIP-1 is https://github.com/okex/OIPs/blob/master/OIP-1.md.
